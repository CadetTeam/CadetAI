# Clerk Dashboard Debugging Guide

## Current Issue
The sign-up process says "creating account" but users are not being created in Clerk and Supabase. This suggests there might be a configuration issue in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Steps to Debug

### 1. Check Clerk Dashboard Email Verification Settings

**Go to:** https://dashboard.clerk.com â†’ Your Project â†’ User & Authentication â†’ Email, Phone, Username

**Check these settings:**
- âœ… **Email address verification**: Should be ENABLED
- âœ… **Verification method**: Should be "Email code" (not "Magic link")
- âœ… **Require verification**: Should be ON

**If email verification is DISABLED:**
- This would cause sign-ups to complete immediately without OTP
- Users would be created but might not sync properly to Supabase
- **Solution**: Enable email verification

### 2. Check Production Environment

**Go to:** https://dashboard.clerk.com â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ API Keys

**Verify you're in the PRODUCTION environment:**
- Look for "Production" tab (not "Development")
- Keys should start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`
- These should match your Vercel environment variables

### 3. Check Domain Configuration

**Go to:** https://dashboard.clerk.com â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Domains

**Verify these domains are configured:**
- âœ… `my.cadetai.com` (Production)
- âœ… `cadetai.com` (if used)

### 4. Check Webhook Configuration

**Go to:** https://dashboard.clerk.com â†’ Your Project â†’ Webhooks

**Verify webhook is configured:**
- âœ… **Endpoint URL**: `https://my.cadetai.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
- âœ… **Events**: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
- âœ… **Status**: Active

### 5. Test with Fresh Email

**Try signing up with a completely new email address:**
1. Go to `https://my.cadetai.com/auth-unified`
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Use a NEW email address (not ones you've tested before)
4. Fill in all fields
5. Submit the form
6. Check console logs for: `ðŸš€ AUTH FLOW v2.0 - Fixed bypass logic`

### 6. Console Logs to Look For

**Good signs (new flow):**
```
ðŸš€ AUTH FLOW v2.0 - Fixed bypass logic
Sign-up result: missing_requirements
Email verification required, preparing verification
```

**Bad signs (old flow):**
```
Signup returned missing_requirements; bypassing OTP and signing in directly
Bypass sign-in failed: e: Couldn't find your account
```

## Most Likely Issues

1. **Email verification disabled** - Users complete signup without OTP
2. **Wrong environment** - Using development keys instead of production
3. **Browser cache** - Old JavaScript still running
4. **Domain mismatch** - Clerk not configured for production domain

## Quick Fixes

### Clear Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Force New Deployment
The latest deployment should include the fixed code. If you're still seeing old behavior:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for CDN cache to clear
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check console for the new debug message

### Verify Environment Variables
Check Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` starts with `pk_live_`
4. Verify `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` starts with `sk_live_`
